## About Me
My research focuses on the development of scalable, intelligent systems that enable safe autonomy for real-world deployment. My work spans decentralized multi-robot coordination, active learning, and scalable surface manufacturing through compact robotic platforms. From developing algorithms for credit-card-sized mobile robots capable of generating micro-structured surfaces to safe, decentralized swarm coverage with limited connectivity, I focus on creating robust, adaptive solutions that operate reliably in uncertain, dynamic environments. 

I am particularly interested in control-driven methods for active learning, real-time decision-making. My research has been featured in IROS, RSS, RA-L, and Mechatronics, and has been validated in simulation, real-world experiments, and DARPA field tests. I’m motivated by the challenge of transforming high-level specifications—whether from users or sensor data—into actionable, resilient behaviors for autonomous agents.

### Background
I am currently a Ph. D. Candidate at Northwestern University advised by Todd Murphey in the [Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/) expected to graduate in 2025. I attended Stanford University and graduated witha B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2017.
